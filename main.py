#Find an example where g is a Prim Root mod p:prime but not mod p^2
#this means you would have to use g + p as the prim root

#func: isPrime

#func: Euler Phi Function
#       break into primes then multiply by the PHI(prime)

#func: determine if g is a primitive root
#       if Ord_p(g) = PHI(p)

#later add user input
